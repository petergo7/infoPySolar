1. Version a0.001 - Fixed QML file path
2. Version a0.002 - Added Change Log
Version a0.003 - Tried some new things with CMake and QML :)
Verison a0.004 - Reverted to something like a0.001 due to errors :(
Version a0.005 - Fixed QML file path (Yes, again)
Version a0.006 - Everything fixeed and program working fine with Python Launcher. Probably won't touch CMake again, but yeah. Probably editing QML file later.
Version a0.007.NST - Mostly added just an image, as a background, not stable function to version name added.

BTW: .NST versions are not stable and .ST versions are stable 

I really should add a version notes file.
